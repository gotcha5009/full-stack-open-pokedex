# Exercise 11.1

        I would like to choose Rust as the discussing language. Rust is a system programming language used behind many enterprise services e.g. Figma, Sentry, or even npm. According to the official website, Cargo is the tool for build and test. Cargo is the package manager for Rust like npm for node.js. Like 'package.json', we have 'Cargo.toml' for project's configuration. Because Rust is like C and Java; it needs to be compiled into an executable. Inside Cargo's ecosystem, we are working with a higher-level "package" abstraction. It is a tool that allows Rust packages to declare their various dependencies and ensure that youâ€™ll always get a repeatable build. Cargo has a command 'cargo build' to build an executable file to the target directory using native 'rustc' Rust compiler. It also has '--release' parameter which is used for production build. For testing, Rust also has built-in test command for create test suites without having to rely on external libraries. For linting, we use Clippy, which is work like eslint in JavaScript. Clippy can read 'clippy.toml' file for configuration like '.eslintrc'
        Next, besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are many, many tools to help you create CI such as Travis CI, Circle CI, GitLab, AWS CodePipeline, etc. For example, AWS CodePipeline is the service provided by, of course, Amazon Web Service, which provides graphical interface for workflows to help you work on the CI efficiently. Furthermore, the tools is hosted on cloud meaning that you don't have to worry about setup. There is also BitBucket Pipelines which is similar to GitHub Actions. I have worked on BitBucket Pipelines in deployment workflow during my internship.
        Lastly, if the development team is consisted of 6 people, I'd like to choose cloud-based environment over the self-hosted because of the cost and time consumption. Assume that you are using self-hosted environment. You need to prepare the setup all by yourself which is too much 6 people who already have responsibility on development. With cloud-based solution, all the setup and hosting are prepared by service provider who help you reduce excessive cost and cut out preparation time.
